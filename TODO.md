# TODOs

No need for a project board in a boilerplate.

## Features
- Add Astro web app (named web)
- Change "users" mock data for "news" (more proper for static sites)

## Cleanup
- Review usage / need for "web" packages
- Review usage of deps / packages related to Astro usage
  - SCSS instead of Styled-components, probably can change stylelint config and other stuff
- Rework /docs directory (new Astro feature, review of existing stuff)
- Review if we need .npmrc the way it is

## Bugs

- Fix "web" package build, re-add CI step (Module not found: Can't resolve '@acme/db')
