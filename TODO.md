# TODOs

No need for a project board in a boilerplate.

## Features

### Astro web app

- Setup eslint with shared config
  - Also add CI step
- Setup stylelint with shared config (switch styled-components stuff for SCSS)
  - If necessary only
  - Also add CI trigger
- Add some images

## Cleanup

- Rework /docs directory (new Astro feature, review of existing stuff)
- Review if we need .npmrc the way it is
- Remove "BIG WIP" text in README.md, review project description
